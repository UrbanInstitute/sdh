<p>Brittany Corprew sat under the glow of the Christmas lights that lit up her drafty living room. It was December and the weather was starting to turn in Arlington, the northwest Baltimore neighborhood where this 24-year-old mother and her family had recently relocated.</p>

<p>As she sat pressed up against her 26-year-old fiancé, Dominic Wade, Brittany took inventory of the house’s many problems: bug-infested rooms, broken gutters, a leak in the basement, and paint peeling off the walls—but the house was theirs.</p>

<p>Dominic’s parents gave it to them so that they they could have a rent-free home in which to raise their children. Brittany and Dominic just had to figure out a way to afford a slew of much-needed repairs.</p>

<p>“We were kind of scared,” Brittany said. “Where are we going to get the money from? How are we going to do it? It was in pretty bad shape.”

Two of the goals Mariah set for herself were to get a driver’s license and to get a car, both of which she accomplished once Ezekiel was born. Being able to drive herself around has greatly improved Mariah’s well-being, especially since her town does not have many public transportation options. By having her own car, Mariah can take Ezekiel to the doctor, attend parenting classes, and go to the store to buy food for her family.

<p>Dominic was well aware that the house was deteriorating before they moved in because he grew up in it. Brittany had lived in it too when the couple first got serious and Dominic’s parents moved down the street. But after that, they had two kids and were forced to move into Brittany’s grandmother’s downtown home, for the sake of their children’s health and their own.</p>

<p>Before Brittany and Dominic had their daughter Peyton, and their son Dominic, Jr., the house affected Brittany’s asthma. But even after the family moved downtown things did not improve much. All four family members shared one mattress in a single bedroom for two years. The house was full of pets and Brittany and her children suffered multiple asthma attacks requiring medical attention.</p>

<p>So they moved back to Arlington, determined to find a way to make it work; to fix the house and build a healthier life in it.</p>

<p>As Brittany sat on the couch on that December day, her brother, Stephano, came through the door with Peyton in his arms. In her tiny hand was a pamphlet that her teacher had given to her during school. And inside that pamphlet was an answer that this family was desperately seeking.

<h3>The Case for a Healthier Home</h3>

<p>Hector Moreno suspiciously eyed the paint chips dangling from the columns in front of the house. The collective pattern formed by the chips on the wood resembled the texture of alligator skin, usually a tell tale sign that the paint contains lead, a serious health risk, especially for children.</p>

<p>Moreno inspects houses for the Green and Healthy Homes Initiative (GHHI), a Baltimore-based organization that sprung from the Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning. For the past 30 years, these organizations have worked to eliminate lead as a health risk in Baltimore’s low-income homes, and in more recent years, to mitigate conditions that lead to asthmatic symptoms.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long for Moreno to recognize that Brittany and Dominic’s house presented a number of major concerns.</p>

<p>Beyond the paint chips, he found pest-killing chemical traps and burning incense sticks deployed all over the house, a weakening roof, mold and water damage, ventilation and insulation issues, a withering porch and deck, a dysfunctional furnace, a broken water heater, a damaged refrigerator, and a hazardous electrical panel.</p>

<p>“Their house literally had everything in it that we normally deal with,” said Rebecca Jackson, a project manager at GHHI who worked with Moreno on the assessment.
Above all, the house contained a lot of potential triggers for asthma attacks.</p>

<p>Asthma is a serious condition that can have ripple effects felt long after an attack ends. When children have an asthma attack they often miss school, may need go to the emergency room, or even end up hospitalized. Then parents miss work. One of the leading causes of job loss—especially among low-income workers—is missing shifts.</p>

<p>GHHI also understands the importance of weatherized housing. Without it, low-income families have to pay even more to heat or cool their homes, or risk getting sick. The fallout is that energy bills then eat up too much income, and other necessities—such as food or medicine—can go unmet.</p>

<p>Low-income families often live in places with concentrated environmental risks, but are rarely able to prevent or mitigate the problems that endanger their health.</p>

<p>In other words, they need help and GHHI wants to provide it.</p>

<p>That’s why GHHI shares informational brochures at schools, churches, gyms, and community centers, places they know they can reach those in need.  </p>

<p>These outreach efforts led Payton to bring home the  pamphlet that connected Brittany to GHHI. And that’s how Moreno made his way to their home and wrote an assessment for roughly $30,000 of work.</p>

<p>But with so many home repairs on the to-do list, the initiative now had to find a way to pay for them.
</p>  


<h3>Paying the Bills</h3>

<p>After submitting her application, Brittany was contacted by Liza Brandli, a data management and evaluation specialist at GHHI. Liza asked about the children’s history with asthma, hospital visits, medications, among other things.  She also </p> 
    
<p>Following the house inspection, Rebecca Jackson uploaded to the same system information regarding the home’s trouble spots and related repairs.</p> 

<p>GHHI helps identify multiple programs – such as XXX and YYY – than can help families with home repairs, in Brittany’s case blending funds from federal, state and other sources.</p>

<p>Using funds wisely is key, emphasized Wendy Webster, GHHI’s VP of Maryland Program Services, because grant funds offer a finite amount of money and GHHI aims to wield everything available to address all the health hazards in a family’s home, not just some of them.</p> 
<p>“We try to capitalize on every grant fund that we can first,” Williams said. “The philanthropy money is what we use last. If you didn’t use all your other funds first and just relied on philanthropy money, you’d blow through that in 10 seconds.”  </p> 
<p>Once repairs have been made, GHHI follows up with clients for months after the intervention to see how the children are faring, if they have been to the hospital or missed school.</p> 

<p>GHHI surveyed 213 client families served between 2009 and early 2015 and found that in the six months after the repairs, visits to the emergency room and days missed at school declined by roughly 34 percent.</p>

<h3>A Fitter Future</h3>

<p>GHHI has expanded to 16 communities beyond Baltimore, with plans to expand into eight more. The needs are widespread and the benefits go well beyond the housing.</p>

<p>“It’s that healthy start that [those kids] are going to get after this home gets done,” Webster said. “It’s for the family that may live there the next time, and the family that may live there after that family. It’s really about the social condition of a community.”</p>

<div class="container"> 
<p>One potential funding stream GHHI is currently pursuing is pay for success deals, where philanthropies and financial institutions invest in a program with the opportunity to earn interest when pre-agreed upon outcomes are achieved. </p>

<p>“[Right now], we don’t have a one-size-fits-all wand,” Webster said. “[We] probably spend the most time figuring out how to maximize opportunities to serve the family. [But] there are some people who slip through the cracks.”</p>

This activity, which Mariah learned from Vickie, is teaching Ezekiel about social interaction, developing his motor skills, and helping him bond with Mariah.</figcaption>
</figure>
    

<p>But by having more funds to broadly address health in homes, GHHI believes it would serve more families in more places, keep more people in school and at work, and lower Medicaid spending.</p>
<p>Brittany and Dominic’s immediate future involves a new addition to the family. They’re expecting their third child in September and are relieved to be fixing the house just in time.</p>

<p>They are also focused on helping out as their grandparents and parents age and confront their own medical issues. Being just down the street from Dominic’s parents certainly helps.</p>

<p>The house could also serve as a base from which to generate more income: Brittany is a certified child care provider and hopes to use her newly renovated home to run a daycare business, supplementing the money Dominic earns driving disabled patients to doctor’s appointments.</p>

<p>But more than anything Brittany and Dominic’s home is where they now hope their children can grow up safe, healthy, and close to their roots.</p>

<p>“We’ve been through everything,” Brittany said. “We hope to live happily ever after.”
