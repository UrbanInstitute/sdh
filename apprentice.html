        <p>In her lowest moments, Elise Feldt believed the doubters who said she should give up her kids. She was a 25-year-old single mother working two jobs and often went days without seeing her boys, who were left in their grandmother’s care as Elise worked. Still, she could barely afford her rent and counted on church donations of food for her family.</p>

<p>“I was close to crushing defeat several times,” she said. “It’s hard being at that moment where you wonder if people are right, if you do need to give up your kids… I just needed to know they were going to be OK.”</p>
        
<p>Though she excelled in high school, Elise dropped out of college at 19 when she became pregnant with her first son, Everett. It was her first step off the traditional college-to-career path she had always envisioned. And returning to that path became harder and more impractical the longer she was away.</p>

<p>Nearly 30 percent of college students drop out after their first year, often because they can’t balance school, work, and family. In a Pew Research Center survey, two-thirds of adults ages 18 to 34 who do not have a bachelor’s degree said that a major reason for not continuing their education is their need to support their family; 48 percent said they can’t afford to go to college. </p>
               
<p>Even among those who did get a four-year degree, only half (55 percent) said their education was “very useful” in helping them prepare for a job or career and another 33 percent said it was “fairly useful.” That leaves a decent share of students who are not getting their career needs met through traditional colleges and universities, not to mention that many students—whether they graduate or not—end up saddled with crushing tuition debt.</p>

<p>For Elise, and many others, the path to getting job skills, an education, and a career wasn’t college—it was an apprenticeship. </p>

<h3>An unexpected career path</h3>
<p>After Everett was born, Elise and Everett’s father married and had a second son, Avi. Although Elise worked on and off during their marriage, her job prospects were slim without a college degree. When they divorced, Elise struggled to support her family alone. </p>

<p>When her uncle told her about The Apprentice School, a vocational school founded by Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia, Elise was excited by the idea and hoped an apprenticeship would give her and her family more stability and a better home life. She applied and was accepted as a pipe fitter in 2011.  </p>

<p>Through her apprenticeship, Elise was able to learn job skills through college courses while receiving on-the-job training. Rather than paying tuition, students earn an average salary of $X. Graduates are guaranteed a job with Newport News Shipbuilding, which builds aircraft carriers and submarines for the Navy as a division of military contractor Huntington Ingalls Industries. </p>

<p>“They give us firsthand, real-world experience,” Elise said. She would take what she learned in class—math, ship design, programming skills—and apply it directly to her job. “Slowly but surely you become more and more knowledgeable and it builds on itself. It’s such an efficient way of going about teaching someone.” </p>

<p>More important for Elise, the apprenticeship gave her the time and financial resources to take care of her kids. What she may not have known is that the work was also good for her health—and the health of her family. </p>
    
<h3>Better jobs, better health</h3>
<p>In February, Elise sat in the dining room of her home watching her son Avi, 9, spoon a heap of Cinnamon Toast Crunch into his mouth. Avi broke the silence and murmured something to her. Her eyes lit up, and together they giggled at his joke. Five years ago, these quiet moments between Elise and her two sons were rare. </p>
        
<p>Back then, working full-time at Ace Hardware and weekends as a waitress and bartender left her with little time or energy. Some days she only saw her kids to tuck them into bed, and she could see how her exhaustion and stress were rubbing off on them.</p>

<p>According to a report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: “Evening and night shifts, holding multiple jobs, long work hours and excessive overtime work can be detrimental to health.” These traits, which are common to low-wage jobs, can wear on people, affecting their health and their ability to care for the health and well-being of their children.</p>

<p>Stable, well-paying work, on the other hand, is good for your health. Steady employment and higher earnings allow families to afford healthy food, homes in safe neighborhoods, quality child care, stability, and other advantages that translate into better health. </p>

<p>Unemployment, meanwhile, has been associated with poorer physical and mental health and higher mortality. Compared with continuously employed workers, laid-off workers are 54 percent more likely to have “fair or poor health” and 83 percent more likely to develop a stress-related condition such as heart disease. What’s more, children in households where parents are not working are more likely to have chronic illnesses, experience anxiety or depression, and be out of work themselves in the future. </p>

<p>As an apprentice, Elise works and attends classes within a regular 40-hour workweek, leaving her time to spend with her children. She earned enough to move her family to a better apartment, in a neighborhood with a swimming pool the boys could use. “I wanted to move to someplace where they would feel safe to play outside,” she said. </p>

<p>A few years later, she remarried and moved with the boys into a new house with her husband Richard. </p>

<p>“The Apprentice School saved my family,” Elise said. “My family life is a lot more stable now… I get to come home and help my kids with their homework. Sometimes they even help me a little bit with my homework….It’s been a chance to build a home and a home life.”</p>

        <h3>The case for expanding apprenticeships</h3>
<p>Not all employers have the benefit of Navy contracts to support their apprenticeships. In 2015, the Obama administration announced that the Department of Labor was awarding $175 million in grants to expand apprenticeships in high-growth and high-tech industries, such as health care and IT. </p>

<p>Apprenticeships should be expanded because they work, said Robert I. Lerman, senior fellow at the Urban Institute. Research has shown that they are highly cost-effective and smooth the transition from school to work. And countries with robust apprenticeship systems have lower youth unemployment rates.</p>

<p>“In most professions, the ‘learning-by-doing’ model is good,” Lerman said. For employers, apprenticeships are “sort of a tryout employment. And very often, the apprentices have a greater commitment to the firm.”</p>

<p>Communities also benefit because apprenticeships help develop a skilled workforce, connect schools to businesses, and build a stronger foundation for a more productive local economy.</p>

<p>After two years as a pipe fitter, Elise was accepted into an advanced program at The Apprentice School. She’s now studying modeling and simulation and is nearly done with her associate’s degree. She is also active in student government at the school and, last year, was the chairperson of the publications committee. After her apprenticeship ends, she plans to continue working for Newport News Shipbuilding. </p>
      <p>“There is so much opportunity here,” Elise said. “They’ve given me leaps and bounds in my career that I never could have taken in the amount of time I’ve done it in.”</p>
